    "2.\tEven after trying for so many times, your friend’s startup could not find the investment. So you decided to take this matter in your hand and try to find the list of investors who probably can invest in your friend’s startup. Your list will increase the chance of your friend startup getting some initial investment by contacting these investors. Find the top 5 investors who have invested maximum number of times (consider repeat investments in one company also). In a startup, multiple investors might have invested. So consider each investor for that startup. Ignore undisclosed investors."
